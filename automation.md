# Automation

Automation is used to reduce manual toil, shrink variance, and make outcomes repeatable.

## Automation goals

- Reduce ticket volume through self-healing and proactive remediation
- Standardise actions (no “tribal knowledge” operations)
- Improve time-to-resolution with clear, scripted recovery paths

## Typical automation themes

- Device health checks and posture validation
- Drift detection and remediation
- Enrollment / provisioning helpers
- Reporting pipelines (inventory, compliance, patch status)
- Knowledge base generation and maintenance workflows

## Operational approach

Automation is treated like production software:
- version controlled
- tested where feasible
- documented
- owned and maintainable
